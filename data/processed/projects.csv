101226563|M-CARE|Implementation of an Integrated Care Model for Patients with Multiple Cardiometabolic and Mental Health Conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa|2025-07-01|2030-06-30|4000000|HORIZON.2.1|HORIZON-HLTH-2024-DISEASE-13-01|HORIZON-HLTH-2024-DISEASE-13|HORIZON-HLTH-2024-DISEASE-13|HORIZON-RIA|Addressing multiple long-term conditions including non-communicable diseases (MLTC-NCDs) in fragile health systems in sub-Saharan African(SSA) demands a shift from fragmented models of care, that treat individual health issues separately to a more holistic integrated care  that provides a whole-person focus. However, the feasibility and effectiveness of concurrently implementing evidence-based WHO PEN and mhGAP-IG for integrated care of NCDs and common mental health problems in real primary healthcare settings remain unexplored. In addition, the adoption and implementation of the WHO PEN and mhGAP-IG strategy has been poor in the SSA, where recent analysis found the adoption and implementation to be off-track. M-CARE project therefore aims to improve primary care for patients (aged ≥18 years) with MLTC-cardiometabolic and common mental health conditions in three SSA countries (Ghana, Kenya & Uganda) by designing, deploying, and evaluating strategies for implementing the evidence-based integrated primary care model interventions that map onto WHO PEN and mhGAP-IG for PHC, taking into account diverse socioeconomic environments of these countries.The  intervention delivery will be a pragmatic trial implemented in usual primary care facilities by primary care providers through a parallel arm cluster randomized design. The trial is preceded by codesign of the integrated care with stakeholders.  This  multi-sectoral approach will increase  the capability, opportunity to improve integrated management of patients with MLTC-cardiometabolic disease and common mental health disorders in diverse SSA environments. We anticipate that the M-CARE project will lead to 35% increase in proportion of patients with MLTC-NCDs to be engaged and retained in care for effective management within 12 months. The M-CARE project will pave the way for translation and broad scale-up implementation of the evidence-based interventions to manage patients with MLTC-NCDs in SSA and beyond.||Cluster Health

Coastal “Blue carbon” ecosystems, such as mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and storage, biodiversity and coastal protection. Despite their socio-economic and biological importance, they face numerous threats from human activities and climate change, necessitating their conservation and management. Mapping, modelling and monitoring coastal zones using Earth Observation (EO) data is essential for this task. It needs to consider the complex coastal dynamics, past and future change scenarios, and the interaction between Blue Carbon and the coastal zone dynamics. By integrating EO data, advanced modelling techniques, and detailed process-based morphodynamic models, COASTS aims to develop a downstream service for coastal observation, with a focus on Blue Carbon. This service, utilizing Copernicus Marine and other initiatives, will provide govern. stakeholders and coastal planning with relevant information for developing coastal management strategies, including the assessment of blue carbon habitats and their environmental services. Further, COASTS will develop innovative methods and comprehensive analyses to create new business models related to emergent blue carbon markets and will offer new international income sources for countries with blue carbon ecosystem presence. COASTS will initially focus on pilot sites in Germany, Jersey Island and Chausey Archipelago, and the Maldives where govern. customers have a demand and support the project. The learnings from these examples will form a blueprint for broader application in other regions in response to a growing global need. Supported by an interdisciplinary team and strong links with governmental institutions, the COASTS project presents an innovative, scaleable and sustainable approach to coastal conservation and blue carbon management.|10.3030/101180091|Other

The tools developed will provide assessment of the safety (toxicity to humans, ecotoxicity to environment and workers risk) and, at the same time, sustainability guidance to design ecofluids (coolants, greases, oils)  in a clear and holistic way regarding the foreseeable physico-chemical properties and  tribological performance. The safety assessment will be realized by using molecular dynamic models developed by the partners.The tribological models will allow the prediction of the energy consumption during use by providing friction force values, and expected durability  of the materials by using wear data about the materials in contact with different fluids. they will also provide information about tthe degradation of the fluids in use and the chemical reactions occurring. The models will be flexible enough to predict the behaviour of the materials for different working parameters applied for different applications (wind turbines, electric cars and waterborne) This ambitious and forward-thinking system will leverage on a series of tools, ranging from technical evaluation and prediction models (computational models supported by artificial intelligence), combined with  established Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA) methodologies to consider the environmental, social and economic impact.The project will move in close collaboration with already funded European projects as i-Tribomat (H2020 G.A. 814494) for the creation of a OiTB for tribological materials, OntoCommons (H2020 G.A. 958371) for the standardisation of data documentation across all domains related to materials and manufacturing and IRISS (HORIZON EUROPE G.A. 101058245), the international ecosystem for accelerating the transition to Safe-and-Sustainable-by-design materials, products and processes.|10.3030/101138807|Cluster 4

From a health and societal perspective, the number of colonoscopies is bound to increase as they are the only way to screen patients for early cancer detection. Many European countries have national screening programs. This is a very big market in need of improved technology.IRE enables a new generation of intelligent robots that through data, simulation and learning can interact with the interior of a living human while communicating with a human operator. The huge variation of human anatomy and the dynamic effect of human physiology make it a complicated navigational task to use endoscopes. Entanglement, haemorrhage, and perforation risks create a critical and difficult environment to navigate autonomously in where even trained human operators meet challenges. We exploit one of the largest datasets on real-life colonoscopies with more than 2,000 operations to learn safe navigation, combined with simulated training on a population of biomechanical models of the abdominal region.IRE boosts the design and configuration of the robotic endoscope using digital twins and simulation, and careful inclusion of clinicians will speed up the process of integration. IRE will raise the level of autonomy by building upon simulation, imaging, and learning to yield an increased interpretation and understanding of the complex real- world environments, capable of anticipating the effect of human motions, adapting and replanning to avoid entanglement.|10.3030/101135082|Cluster 4

EAC is notorious for its highly aggressive biological behavior leading to invasive disease and early metastases. The only way to reduce mortality is through treatment in early stage of the cancer. EAC has a well recognized premalignant precursor lesion identified as esophageal metaplasia, or Barrett’s Esophagus (BE), which offers important opportunities for treatment in early stages of cancer which may reach 5 years survival rates up to 80%. However, these patients need to be monitored constantly for timely intervention in case of disease recurrence or metastases. The problem is that after endoscopic treatment up to 30% of cases will develop recurring cancers or even present with metastases, which requires additional endoscopic treatments or surgery. Currently it is impossible to predict which of the treated BE patients with  will have stable disease and which will recur or progress to invasive cancer. As a consequence all treated patients need to remain in frequent endoscopic surveillance. This leads to over-treatment of a large group of BE patients and under-treatment of those with more aggressive disease. There is a low cost effectiveness of endoscopic therapies, low quality of life of patients and poor satisfaction of care providers. An accurate risk stratification method for early AEC in BE patients is therefore an unmet clinical need. The ambition of the ENDEAVOR  consortium is to implement an innovative risk stratification method, which encompasses minimally invasive cell collection supplemented by single cell genomic analysis to address this specific need. Taking into account patient characteristics, gender dimensions, an optimal model model will be tested in a randomized controlled prospective trial. Future implementation of this method will reduce health care costs, increase quality of life and satisfaction of health care providers.

Its main objective is to develop a new high-speed ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) that will be designed and optimized for active antennas and digital beamforming.  Its performances will be validated on a dedicated demonstration board and in a specific use case. The final component will reach TRL7 and will be space-qualified. It responds to the challenges of the digital beamforming application by providing an integrated 8 channels devices with very low power that is able to make direct conversion up to the X-band. It will generate new knowledge on the possibility to move from the X-band to the Ka-band. The new ADC will be highly suitable for a wide range of applications, from telecommunications to Earth Observation and GNSS, and will respond to the future needs of Europe’s flagship programs, such as the Green Deal. The project addresses the issue of the critical components supply chain, by fully assessing the gaps and potential vulnerabilities, and will propose recommendations at the European and industrial levels. The project also focuses on two key elements, which are the wafer foundry and the circuit’s packaging. The ORION project targets a 90% European supply chain, as the manufacturing, test and qualification are already on European, open-to-all, industrial facilities. The ORION project is led by Teledyne e2v, and fosters cooperation between scientific (Fraunhofer IIS and the Polytechnical University of Madrid), and industrial teams (INDRA and THALES ALENIA SPACE). The partners will implement several measures for exploitation of the results and dissemination to the European scientific, industrial and policy communities.

Steel can be recycled over and over again while retaining its technical properties. However, contaminations of tramp elements and losses of alloying elements do occur in the solid state and liquid state recovery processes currently employed in the industrial value chain. The project aims to enhance the integrated value chain of scrap based steel production through; investigate and develop scrap preparation methods, research new ways of sorting and separation of material, investigate and develop specific methods to remove copper and tin in the liquid phase and to recover copper form steelmaking residues through pyrometallurgical processes, create new steel products that can handle a higher copper content while maintaining required application properties, and finally lab-scale experiments to develop thermodynamic and kinetic modelling focusing on tramp elements. The target is to achieve 90% EOL recovery rates and a reduction of tramp elements by 60-70%, improved separation and sorting of scrap with a targeted increase in separation specificity of 50% and a target of copper element recovery from steelmaking residues about 60%.  Ultimately the developed models will, when relevant, be verified with data from full-scale tests in industrially relevant environments.The consortium includes 8 partners from 5 different EU-countries a scrap recycler (STEIL) / a steelmaker (SIDENOR) – and different R&D entities (KTH, KOBOLDE, TECNALIA, University of Limerick and Politecnico de Bari)  as well as a supplier (LSA) of sensors for scrap identification covering all the competences needed for the development of the MEDALS project|10.3030/101138516|Cluster 4

The iron and steel industry is responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), constituting 5.7% of the total emissions in the EU (2.2 tonnes CO2 per tonne of crude steel cast, refer to World Steel data). Several European steel producers (including ArcelorMittal) have committed to fulfilling the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement and aligning with the European Union's target of achieving zero emissions by 2050, as part of the Green Deal initiative. These engagements entail a shift from the predominant method of steel production, currently reliant on blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace (BF/BOF) technology, to cleaner production techniques characterized by significantly lower CO2 emissions. As the industry shifts toward cleaner production methods, particularly those utilizing electric-arc furnaces (EAF) and emphasizing the recycling of iron scrap, concerns arise about the potential contamination of steel with residual elements like Cu, Sn, As, Sb, and P.The NANO-S-MART project emerges as a response to this pressing need, focusing on the systematic and in-depth analysis of the impact of residual elements in martensitic steels. Martensitic steels, vital across key sectors such as construction, automotive, energy, and defense, play a pivotal role in the EU's efforts to achieve climate neutrality and increase renewable energy usage. The project addresses macro, micro, and nano-scale considerations, encompassing the entire steel production process. NANO-S-MART project aims to provide clear guidelines for redesigning grades and validating technologies in relevant environments. By bridging knowledge gaps and embracing cutting-edge technologies, NANO-S-MART endeavors to revolutionize martensitic steel production, contributing to a sustainable and circular economy in the EU.|10.3030/101178431|Cluster 4

Earlier diagnosis means earlier access to preventive interventions, which are now more effective thanks to next-generation immunotherapies. The clinical use of these new drugs is not consensual though, because of the severe side-effects they inflict in some patients. FluiDx-AD tests offer a pioneering tool to stratify and monitor patients eligible for these drugs, towards reducing their associated risk and accelerating their regulatory clearance in the EU.FluiDx-AD tests are thus devised to work complementarily and sequentially, covering the full AD diagnostic journey (from population-wide screenings to confirmatory diagnosis, and downstream patient stratification and monitoring), tackling key challenges of early AD diagnosis and AD prevention with new drugs, while also paving the way for the development of new therapies by streamlining patient selection and appraisal in clinical trials.FluiDx-AD brings together a team of highly motivated, committed, and reputed entrepreneurs, clinicians, and scientists from biotechs, hospitals, academic centres, and patient organizations across the EU. Leveraging our unique blend of trans-disciplinary/-sectoral expertise and access to advanced technologies and infrastructures, we join forces to realize the vision of a new era of AD clinical management for the benefit of millions of patients globally.|10.3030/101155955|Cluster Health

Despite this, the implementation of the evidence-based WHO Best Buys policies for NCDs prevention in the African region has been found to be off-track. Additionally, less attention has been given to adolescents and yet this is a period in life where behavioural patterns of NCDs risk factors are established and track into adulthood. There is also a gap in our understanding on how to implement and scale up effective diet and physical activity interventions in real world settings in SSA.Our project therefore aims to reduce two important modifiable risk factors for NCDs: unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and their underlying social determinants among adolescents (aged 10-19 years) living in  mixed socio-economic urban communities in two SSA countries (Ghana & Kenya) by designing, deploying, and evaluating strategies for implementation of evidenced and theory based interventions mapped on to the WHO Best Buys. We selected the two countries because they represent different cultural contexts of nutrition transition (East and West Africa), and both countries are undergoing rapid economic development, urbanisation and increases in NCD prevalence. The intervention delivery will take a multi-sectoral approach to increasing the capability, opportunity and motivation of adolescents to eat healthier and be more physically active. We will focus on three settings to enhance the reach: secondary schools and, family/community/faith-based settings and the digital environment using social media. Together, this project will increase opportunities, awareness, knowledge and health literacy, motivate adolescents to increase self-efficacy, guide self-regulatory actions and adopt positive health behaviour (such as dissuasion from physical inactivity and sedentary behaviours, or unhealthy food choices) to prevent NCDs.|10.3030/101095375|Cluster Health

PREMIO COLLAB strives to facilitate improved patient care and streamlined clinical workflows addressing the needs of patients, healthcare professionals, and society.Response evaluation methods for patients with MBC have not been modernised for decades, although molecular imaging with FDG-PET/CT has emerged as a highly accurate method for staging MBC, and staging and monitoring MBC has a profound influence on treatment options and the chances of survival. Furthermore, the patient perspective has rarely been considered, although continuous response evaluation in a monitoring setting has interacted with the life of MBC patients for years. Still, no specific recommendations are provided internationally for response evaluation in MBC or in the overall management of monitoring. PREMIO COLLAB offers complementary competencies in an interdisciplinary collaborative effort to lift this complex task. In a pragmatic multicenter randomised clinical trial (RCT), we will apply the intervention of FDG-PET/CT-based monitoring and compare it with conventional CT as state-of-the-art. The objectives are to analyse the impact of the intervention on overall survival and quality of life in patients with MBC and include cost-effectiveness analyses directly informing HTA agencies and health policymakers. Building on knowledge from the RCT, we will use participatory research designs to develop improved and modernised patient pathways and digital workflows. AI-based solutions in imaging and liquid biopsies constitute perspectives with a broader horizon.The work will be done in multiple European centres and living labs with patient representatives, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders aiming to provide knowledge for updated recommendations with a view to subsequent clinical implementation.This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on ‘‘Diagnostics and Treatment (diagnostics).”|10.3030/101136812|Cluster MISS

Nevertheless, these groups are invariably excluded from pandemic preparedness and response research, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our ambition is to develop a dedicated pregnancy-infant preparedness platform for adaptive trials, to improve pandemic preparedness for these underserved populations.The objectives of PIPELINE are to: 1) establish a multi-country adaptive trials platform that that can support novel diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for infections in pregnancy and infancy, able to pivot rapidly to emerging health threats; 2) create and sustain a responsive and “ever-warm” clinical trial network of sites with expertise in recruiting pregnant women and infants and adaptive trial designs; 3) undertake an adaptive platform trial on respiratory syncytial virus immunisation in pregnant women and infants, to test the platform’s capabilities and address a public health priority for the EU; 4) evaluate novel sampling techniques and immunity approaches with relevance for preparedness; and 5) embed all activities within sustained dissemination, exploitation and communication with key stakeholders to translate results into policy recommendations.We will achieve these objectives through our multidisciplinary partnership with track records in maternal and infant health research, who will leverage and strengthen existing networks to maximise Europe-wide outreach to benefit PIPELINE. Our objectives are aligned with Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-24 Health Destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden” as our work will reduce the health burden of disease through more effective management, lead to improved preparedness of health systems to respond to health emergencies, and reduce citizens’ risk of, and increase their knowledge about, health threats of epidemics.|10.3030/101155852|Cluster Health

OoC is a promising technology potentially able to outperform conventional preclinical models in providing patho-physiologically relevant setting for investigating human diseases, thus tackling the limited translational value of animal testing. OoC wide adoption is currently hampered by poor maturation of cellular models and shortage of non-destructive readout methods. PHOENIX will take current OoC platforms to the next level, overcoming such limitations by integration of core technologies already validated by the Consortium, namely Electric Recording (3dMEA), Force Sensing (3dFORCE) and Mechanical Stimulation (3dMECH).Two platforms will be developed: i) μHeart, to model functional cardiac tissues, and ii) μNMC to model neuro-muscular circuits. PHOENIX ecosystem will be completed by satellite products and qualified against specific contexts of use in clinically and industrially relevant environments. PHOENIX potential will be showcased with two genetic pathologies as demonstrators: LMNA-cardiomyopathies and Freidreich’s Ataxia, conditions in which electrical instability and mechanical impairment play important roles. For each platform, two versions will be released (Base and Pro), addressing the need of identified customer segments (research labs and Pharma/Biotech).In line with the 3Rs, PHOENIX platforms represent the ideal clinically relevant tools to test drugs and gene therapies, leading to faster/safer development processes, reducing the need for animal testing.

EXPOSIGNALZ project aims to delineate the impact of a selection of environmental pollutants on brain health throughout life and their role in dementia especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD) representing about 70% of dementia cases. Through interdisciplinary approaches, integrating experimental and epidemiological studies, our objectives are to: 1) Identify environmental pollutants likely to have neurotoxic effects and pro-amyloidogenic properties predictive of a neurodegenerative trajectory related to AD using in vitro screening models; 2) Characterize pollutant signatures associated with brain aging and AD in biological matrices of 4 European population-based cohorts of various age groups; 3) Understand the mechanisms of action of pollutants identified in the in vitro screenings and those found in biological signatures, using AD-iPSC and AD preclinical models; 4) Explore the impact of pollutants on early neurodevelopment as a factor of susceptibility for later neurodegenerative diseases using brain organoids and gestational contamination models and 5) Disseminate knowledge to policy makers, to the relevant stakeholders and general public in order to define guidelines for disease prevention and take actions for population’s health. The project, which aims to identify chemical pollutants as new risk factors  for dementia as well as  new pollutant-associated biomarkers, could contribute to: (i) reduce or delay the incidence of AD, and thus reduce the economic and social burden; and (ii) allow an earlier diagnosis of AD combined with new disease modifying treatments to delay the entrance of patients in the more severe stages of the pathology.|10.3030/101156353|Cluster Health

Methanol has great potential to be one of the selected low-carbon fuels for heavy road and transportation and marine freight. Technologies that are using methanol as fuel are gaining more momentum and attention globally. However, two key issues may challenge the further uptake of methanol in energy systems: i) methanol is today produced from fossil resources, and ii) methanol is used mainly by chemical industries, leaving small room for the energy sector to count on it. Bio-MeGaFuel is proposing a novel route that converts low value biomass to methanol via an intensified process with a minimum carbon footprint comparable to conventional methods. Bio-MeGaFuel uses chemical looping gasification to produce clean syngas from biomass, and membrane reactor technology to directly produce methanol from syngas. A key feature of Bio-MeGaFuel is the possibility to maximize the conversion of hydrogen and carbon (via CO2 recirculation) from biomass waste to methanol with the minimum number of process steps. The process is based on the conversion of biomass waste aimed at increasing the capacity of biomethanol production in a sustainable way and addressing the increasing demand for biomethanol as a fuel. Bio-MeGaFuel is underpinned by technologies that are being developed to TRL 5 by an expert consortium. Besides, it is backed by a strong reference group including the business leaders and market players in biomass supply, whole methanol production value chain, potential end users, and potential future players in the production, management, and distribution of biomethanol. This greatly ensures the quality of the research and appropriate exploitation of the results predicted in Bio-MeGaFuel.|10.3030/101147737|Cluster 5

On the other hand, the impact of HPPs on water quality and biodiversity up- and downstream is enormous and should also be a target for refurbishing actions. In this context, the SHERPA project will develop and validate innovative technologies for refurbishing current HPPs, namely, 1) AM metallic patches and coatings to minimize damage and enhance resistance to cavitation, 2) new strategies to adapt rotational speed depending on the flow range, 3) advanced air injection systems to improve water quality and efficiency; 4) new runner designs adapted to E-flows increasing performance. Modelling, simulation, and monitoring tools will assess the new solutions of the in terms of energy output, flexible operation, cost-effectiveness, and impact on biodiversity. The goal is to expand and/or adapt the operational range of the HPP to include lower flows, without this harming their lifetime, economic viability, and environmental and social impact.

Key to the GO-Forward approach is to simulate geological processes for pre-drill assessment of reservoir structure and properties, calibrated to geological or geophysical data, rather than extrapolating the properties from those data with geostatistical methods. To this end, GO-Forward focuses on extending and further developing, testing and demonstrating the added value of forward modelling methods originally developed for hydrocarbon exploration, including stratigraphic forward modelling (SFM), diagenesis forward modelling (DFM) and fracture network forward modelling (FFM), to be used for exploration in different geothermal settings of high relevance for Europe. First, the developed approaches will be tested and calibrated in areas with abundant subsurface information and production data, to prove conceptually the applicability of the methods and reproducibility of the results, to optimise and de-risk geothermal exploration. Calibrated model approaches are subsequently applied in areas with limited data availability to demonstrate their capability to increase pre-drill Probability of Success (POS). To support the workflow and further reduce exploration costs, GO-Forward advances ML-based and computational methods to enhance (existing) (sub)surface information for calibration, uncertainty quantification and data assimilation, and (upscaling) routines for flow simulation, DNSH, and techno-economic performance assessment for POS and Value of Information (VOI).  In addition, GO-Forward addresses public awareness of geothermal developments already at the early stages of exploration.

As a first step, the high costs and shortsighted prospection are tackled with passive surface-based imaging methods and uncertainty encompassing modelling alternatives. In parallel to reducing measurement bias, our approach engages a larger population and stakeholder group in search for optimal locations for geothermal exploitation. In the following step, GeoHEAT illuminates the subsurface to an unprecedented extent through a novel georadar probe. The georadar imaging is complemented with drilling-induced microseismicity monitoring and digital rock physics models to create a high-resolution understanding of the reservoir. Our novel, multi-scale approach unlocks the potential of informed deviated drilling, optimal wellbore placement and accurate performance and risk analysis. Throughout the GeoHEAT journey we propose effective and inclusive tools for public engagement and two-way communication while we introduce advanced decision-making tools for policymakers based on probabilistic modelling and uncertainty quantification. To maximize its impact and expediate its success, GeoHEAT consists of a complementary consortium with European leaders in the scientific, industrial, and public domain. The interdisciplinarity of our team allows us to look at geothermal energy exploration from different angles (e.g., geophysics, engineering, seismology, social sciences and humanities) and ensure the technical, scientific, economic and social sustainability of our proposed exploration workflow. By building on the results and expertise of previous and ongoing related projects, GeoHEAT contributes to the European-wide energy transition process to provide reliable, secure and competitive geothermal energy supply|10.3030/101147571|Cluster 5

UPBEAT will create novel UQ methods and tools to support the production of safer and more innovative aircraft structures and engines while reducing uncertainties in product and engineering lifecycles. The project focuses on metal-composite hybrid aerospace engine parts that are lighter, more durable and cheaper. Innovative design solutions for hybrid interfaces can be achieved using metal additive manufacturing (AM) bonded with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). Advanced models of materials and processes will be developed using sophisticated in-situ and ex-situ monitoring and metrology. In aviation engines, the outlet guide vane (OGV) is an essential component that helps de-swirl the flow field from the fan. The OGV's stiffness is crucial as it influences the engine's performance and includes a major load path from its core to the wing. The OGV with two types of CFRP vanes and titanium end fittings will be used as a demonstrator. By combining AM with advanced in-situ melt pool monitoring and characterization (micro-CT & nanoindentation), digital models will be used to optimize design and manufacturing processes and increase awareness on efficiency, safety and risk. This will result in 20-40% weight reduction and 50-70% fewer defects. Streamlined product development reduces qualification time by 30-40% and costs by 25-35%. In-line quality assurance support lowers manufacturing costs by 30-50% and time by 20-30%. UPBEAT will: ✔ Increase understanding of the process, structure, property, & performance with safety focus ✔ Advance process models (AM, CFRP) for planning & optimization ✔ Develop verification and validation using multi-scale models ✔ Integrate UQ in design, materials, manufacturing, qualification, & certification ✔ Demonstration of UPBEAT technologies using a complex aviation use case|10.3030/101147799|Cluster 5

The maximum power that can be extracted from a planar wave is proportional to the wave period and to the square of the wave amplitude but, to extract this power, the hydrodynamic parameters of the Wave Energy Converter must be modified and this means having the availability of producing high reactive forces. The proposed Reciprocating Superconducting Generator (RSG) is simpler than other existing superconducting generators due to the fact that its alternating movement allows the direct integration into wave energy converters where the primary energy source is also moving in a reciprocating way. This RSG consists of a Circular Switched Reluctance Machine housed inside a flexible moving cryostat with bellows, avoiding the need of any feedthrough for any moving part. The machine is cooled down using a Cryogenic Supply System (CSS) which recirculates helium gas through the coils and the radiation screen and current leads at two different temperatures.The project proposes to build a full system prototype to be tested at the laboratory scale and to analyse its implementation into two existing WEC systems developed by two technologists participating in the project.A set of the prototype generator coils will be made from MgB2 superconducting technology, while the other one will use REBCO tapes. The achieved results for different temperatures will be compared. In both cases the proposed technology will profit from the latest advances in superconductivity and very specifically in recent developments in superconducting magnet technology provided by six of the participants, including the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), a world leader in such activities, in a perfect example of bringing the forefront technologies to social applications.|10.3030/101172746|Cluster 5

RAWCLIC revolutionizes the development and analysis of likely future scenarios of RMs demand and supply, considering challenges and opportunities as to material substitution, future RMs potential (geological and urban mine) deposits, processing technologies, circular use of materials, geopolitical shifts, and induced environmental impacts. It enables to identify the i) challenges, and associated risks to supply, ii) opportunities, and iii) potential mitigation measures, at technology, sectoral and EU-levels. It improves and expands existing models, and develops new ones, to assess and analyse the future demand (WP2), supply from secondary (WP3) and primary (WP4) sources, and environmental effects (including climate change, waste generation, land and water use, and biodiversity impacts; WP5). The models are applied to a selection of 20 RMs justified in the context of the twin transition, while ensuring replicability for future modelling exercises.

A third of all the offshore capacity installed could be floating since this technology unlocks wind potential in deeper waters at greater distances offshore. Technological trends have advanced towards high-voltage direct current (HVDC) as a mature solution over long-distance transmission. Dynamic export cables float in the water and carry power from the moving platform to the grid. A key challenge is these cables need to accommodate combined electro-mechanical-thermal stresses. No HVDC dynamic export cables currently exist and industry views this as a critical bottleneck for floating offshore wind development. Therefore, this is a key enabling technology for secure grid integration of large-scale and long-distance floating offshore wind power plants.HVDC dynamic cables for floating offshore applications present unique challenges and risks from technical, environmental, operational, and economical perspectives. To address these complex inter-disciplinary issues, this project brings together a consortium from academic experts, manufacturers, users, and insurance advisors. The project will: (i) validate the insulation reliability of a new dynamic HVDC export cable, (ii) establish fundamental understanding of combined electro-mechanical-thermal aging mechanisms, facilitating the development of test protocols that qualify and verify the integrity of HVDC dynamic cables, (iii) identify routes for material sustainability for the cable to meet the EUs circular economy ambitions, and (iv) use the underpinning technical knowledge gained to reduce risk and build confidence for deploying the new cable technology and thus enhancing the insurability and financial viability of future floating offshore infrastructure.

This will improve the understanding of the impact of alternative fuels (SAF and H2) on non-CO2 aged emissions and refine aerosol-cloud interaction models whilst providing robust data to support future aviation policy decisions.To achieve these objectives, UNIC will develop and enhance novel technologies including a cold oxidation flow reactor and an integrated on-board sensor for real-time CO2 and non-CO2 emission quantification across the entire flight envelope, including cruise. UNIC will conduct extensive laboratory, combustor, engine and flight tests using both conventional and alternative fuels. These extensive tests will go beyond certification testing to provide a comprehensive assessment of pollutantes that impact climate. They will include particle size distributions down to 1 nm , gas- and particle-phase chemical composition, charged particle/ion concentration and ice nucleation potential of emissions, including those of lubrication oil.

Specifically, S2B will transfer the microbial production of butanol from conventional suspension cultivation to a tailored solid-state biocatalytic platform. In this platform, engineered thin-layer assemblies of cyanobacteria and bio-based matrix materials will synergistically enable the redistribution of cell resources, such as energy and carbon flows, towards butanol formation. Simultaneously, S2B will improve light management, enhance CO2 capture efficiency, and facilitate downstream processes by separating butanol from the production medium. Consequently, the primary technological innovation of S2B will be the continuous, long-term direct solar butanol production by photosynthetic cell factories acting as biocatalysts.The process will be integrated with waste effluent and direct air capture, covering the entire value chain from light harvesting and CO2 capture to product separation through the circular economy concept. Acting as a multidisciplinary consortium, S2B will construct a TRL4-level prototype, paving the way for a smooth upscaling process.|10.3030/101172911|Cluster 5

The overall goal is to identify novel targets for therapeutics and to deliver a suite of validated models to assess efficacy and safety of novel compounds (antibodies, inhibitors, and vaccine candidate targets) for Phase I clinical trials. In the first of its six experimental objectives, REFINE characterizes genomic diversity of orthoflaviviruses to select representative clinically relevant strains. A unique strength of the proposal is the extensive suite of model assays (objective 2) designed to unravel the complex dynamics of virus-host interactions at each step of the infection pathway. These assays form a basis for receptor and pathway characterisation (objective 3). Objective 4 aims to asses both efficacy and safety of novel intervention strategies targeting these receptors and pathways, based on nanobodies, peptides and monoclonal antibodies. Objective 5 studies the key infection steps and putative receptors in humans, utilizing previously collected patient samples to ensure real-world applicability of developed strategies. Ultimately, objective 6 is to integrate knowledge gained to establish a robust and sustainable platform capable of rapid validation of new therapeutic interventions. The overall mission of REFINE is to significantly enhance Europe's preparedness and response abilities against the expected wave of mosquito-borne viral diseases. The team members share a lifelong commitment to advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying various aspects of host-pathogen interactions at the human-animal-environment interface.

The ELBEX (Extracted Lepton Beam at the European XFEL) proposal builds on this strength and will set up new opportunities for European scientists and innovators, by providing an extracted high energy electron beam for experiments. With ELBEX we propose a pathfinder project to demonstrate the feasibility of such a facility at the European XFEL. This unique new possibility would strengthen the global competitiveness of the European Research Area and create opportunities for new user groups.The high energy, high charge density and excellent quality of the electron beam, if brought into interaction with a strong laser beam, opens up the study of a range of scientific topics, most prominently, of strong field Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).  For the first time, the Schwinger limit for the electromagnetic field strength, at which non-perturbative QED effects become relevant, could be reached experimentally  in this facility. Studying the particles created in the photon beam dump opens up the possibility to search for feebly interacting particles, complementing current or planned experiments like FASER II or SHiP. In addition, the electron beam itself is at the centre of a range of highly relevant and ambitious experiments in the area of accelerator science and detector science. Within the ELBEX project, the installation of a facility to extract an electron beam from the European XFEL using a fast kicker magnet and to transport it into a multi-purpose experimental area will be prepared. On the condition that a positive decision by the European XFEL council is reached to grant an extended 12-week XFEL shutdown, the installation of the ELBEX facility is an option.|10.3030/101130174|Other

So far, wide-scale applicability of TE devices was limited by their low conversion efficiency, typically 5% at system level at the most. STARTREC will develop and evaluate a new generation of TEG based on the optimal combination of nanostructured Si85Ge15 thermoelectric materials with innovative device architectures designed by simulation:1) Three different materials processing routes using nanostructuration to increase material performances: Additive Manufacturing (AM); Nanostructured Rapid Casting (Nano-RC); Optimized Rapid Casting (O-RC); 2) Innovative device architectures, such as complex forms and cascade architectures, which can considerably improve both their performance and their optimal temperature ranges, and so increase their efficiencies and potential for wider applications.STARTREC aims at doubling TEG efficiencies up to 10% at system level (15% at device level). It will demonstrate their high-performances in relevant environments at TRL5 for three different and complementary high impact use cases (industrial, domestic and space). Technical work will be completed by dedicated life cycle studies to address economic and environmental issues for these TEGs. A strong dissemination and exploitation strategy and novel circular business models will allow the developed solution to open new application opportunities in other sectors. With TEGs produced and commercialized by European industrial leaders, reinforcing EU strategic autonomy in renewable energy technologies, STARTREC has a complete value-chain with two RTOs, two universities, one technological SME and three industrial end-users.STARTREC will serve a global TEG market valued at 447.1 million € in 2020 and forecasted to reach 1365.8 million € by 2030.|10.3030/101160663|Cluster 5

The traditional path is electronic components such as silicon chips (e.g., microcontrollers) integrated onto flexible substrates called “hybrid integration” or “flexible hybrid electronics” in integrated smart systems. We believe that this approach is not a viable long-term solution for future high-volume, low-cost and conformable integrated smart systems.  Our vision is an integrated smart system that is built with only flexible electronic components including analogue circuitry, digital logic and memories. We call such a system a “Natively Flexible Integrated Smart System” or NFISS. NFISSes will enable new products in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods and healthcare wearables that have not been possible before because conventional silicon chips are too costly, too bulky and not conformable. The project will develop a flexible microcontroller unit (FlexMCU), which is the key component missing to enable NFISSes. The FlexMCU must be a low-power chip integrating a variety of functionality to address the functional requirements of the applications in FMCG and healthcare wearables. A novel hybrid complementary low-power thin-film transistor technology (100x per-transistor power reduction) will be developed to fabricate the FlexMCU in a sustainable flexible chip fab with 100-1000x less environmental footprint. The FlexMCU design is tailored to a specific domain composed of an open-source RISC-V based processor with built-in security features, an analogue frontend, on-chip memory and other peripherals. Then, the FlexMCU will be assembled using novel assembly and bonding methods onto a flexible film, which is, in turn, integrated onto a flexible substrate along with other flexible electronic components to build the first proof-of-concept NFISS that will be validated on two healthcare wearable applications.|10.3030/101134936|Cluster 4

Today, 50% of the EU peatland area is degraded due to peat extraction, with a high environmental impact associated and poses a high risk for the Green Transition goals. The horticultural industry depends entirely on peat for growing media, as current alternatives face technical, socio-cultural, and economic barriers. PEATLESS aims to contribute to overcoming these barriers to promote the uptake of sustainable and locally available substrates blends with reduced peat content in selected horticultural systems: mushrooms, seedlings and ornamental. These blends will be designed through co-creation and will be tailored to sectorial needs. The performance of these alternative media will be demonstrated and showed to growers at commercial facilities across 4 key regions for horticulture. To demonstrate performance and support decision-making, a digital sensoring system for results monitoring will be developed. To overcome socio-cultural barriers, social innovation, educational and innovative dissemination activities will boost knowledge exchange to raise growers’ confidence in alternatives to peat. To overcome economic barriers, an integral feasibility assessment will be developed (e.g., LCSA) followed by new business and organisational models’ creation. Furthermore, an upscaling plan to replicate the PEATLESS approach at national and European levels will ensure project continuation. This 3-year project involves 12 partners from 4 countries, including RTOs, universities, industry, end-users’ representatives and decision-makers, following a multi-actor approach. By 2050, significant long-term impact is expected, predominantly: 1) Environmental: 2.5m m3 of peat saved with a reduction of 900k t CO2eq); 2) Socio-economic: 5,000 horticultural business with PEATLESS substrates across 40 regions; 3) Policy: +30 recommendations.|10.3030/101216569|Cluster 6

It funds community experiments that seek social or technological innovations within the three key thematic areas of the project (mobility, food and energy), addressing the needs identified by residents and local entities such as NGOs, associations and city administration.Tampere HEIs play a crucial role by developing and managing a new knowledge transfer hub for sustainable urban prosumerism, integrating this process also into their strategic work. The project aims to create a novel theoretical understanding of the urban prosumerism model through co-creation and experimental community projects. This model can serve as an example for participatory climate action in cities, with potential for scaling and replication in other Mission cities across Finland and Europe.|10.3030/101216923|Cluster MISS

Global warming can be felt by how people experience heat at home - which is often a combination of the temperature and air humidity in their residence. Experienced heat and heat stress may vary across people’s houses, also depending on the adaptation strategies they apply and affect people’s health outcomes and experiences. Migrant populations, ranging from migrants to their descendants, are often excluded from current data collection and measures, creating environmental injustice, and in turn strengthening social and ethnic inequalities in societies. The HARARA project aims to contribute to the EU Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change by supporting regions such as Belgium and the Netherlands, and more specifically, their cities and local authorities, to become more resilient in the face of climate change impacts. HARARA will systematically integrate insights from multiple disciplines (sociology, ecology, biology, urban planning, etc.), as well as societal and educational institutions, to first empirically assess both subjective and objective climate impacts on migrant groups. Afterwards, a citizen science approach will be taken to empower local migrant communities to actively participate in and contribute to inclusive climate policies of the future through the development of inclusive climate adaptation practices. The inclusive climate adaptation practices will be included in the EC Mission Portal; triangulated with stakeholders, presented in policy briefs and a Toolkit for schools, two sustainable and inclusive fairs, and reports for non-academic audiences. Furthermore, HARARA sets up transdisciplinary knowledge hubs, supported by integration specialists or Gluon researchers, that secure future regional collaborations and transdisciplinary research practices.|10.3030/101216412|Cluster MISS

Multiple stressors such as climate change and pollution from local and remote sources affect human life, wildlife and the ecosystems of the Arctic. These are inseparably connected and require a holistic approach to analyses and assessments of pollution issues, and to their solutions. Using this One Health approach, ArcSolution will provide knowledge and mitigating solutions, co-created with the people of the Arctic. The Arctic is home to a variety of Arctic communities. To capture this diversity, ArcSolution will work in four Arctic locations, i.e. Northern Finland, Svalbard, Northern Norway (Tromsø) and Greenland, integrating local and Indigenous knowledge with environmental, health, technical and social science research in a One Health approach. The One Health framework will be instrumental in identifying knowledge and data gaps, and in synthesizing the information generated and collected in ArcSolution. In addition to scientifically relevant priority pollutants (e.g. per-/polyfluorinated alkylated substances, mercury, (micro)plastics and their additives, and key pathogens), ArcSolution will provide room for research and citizen science projects on locally prioritized issues. We will study pollution from local and remote sources in a climate change context, pollutant accumulation in food webs and human exposure. We will also evaluate current and predict future impacts of these pollutants on Arctic ecosystems and human health. Together with the local communities, we will develop solutions in the fields of circular economy, technology and chemicals management. Our results will be used in education programmes at Arctic schools already connected to ArcSolution. They will be communicated to policy-makers, industry and the scientific community.

In view of the possible irreversibility associated with such events and the potentially catastrophic global consequences on climate, ecosystems, and society, the precautionary principle demands thorough investigation of the underlying mechanisms, compound or cascading impacts, and associated risks. ClimTip will substantially advance the process understanding of possible Earth system Tipping Elements (TEs). It will provide the methodological framework for characterising and constraining potential TEs from paleoclimate, observational and model data, for identifying unknown tipping potential from observations and models, and for quantifying resilience and changes thereof in climate and ecosystems, including early-warning of forthcoming transitions. Earth system models (ESMs) are the primary tool for projecting the risk of large-scale tipping events and ClimTip will substantially improve their representation of suggested TEs. This will enable the identification of safe operating spaces for a stable Earth system by characterising key Earth system TEs in terms of their critical thresholds and rates, hysteresis and overshoot potential via empirical data and ESMs, taking into account the associated uncertainties.

Such breakthrough laser will build the foundation of next greenhouse gases (GHG) spaceborne sensors by Integrated Path Differential Absorption Lidar (IPDA), by which GHG of interest can be probed in the 1.6m or 2m eye-safe regions. To meet the stringent spectral, spatial beam, and power properties required, efficient and versatile wavelength converters such as Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPOs) pumped by mature 1m power lasers are key enabling technologies. This is also the approach in the European Methane Remote Sensing Lidar Mission (MERLIN).SIROCO will mature innovative critical optical space technologies to TRL6, including a hybrid fiber/bulk 1m laser combined with a new Backward Wave OPO (BWOPO) concept.

Accelerating particles to higher energies will always require a large amount of energy. In a society where energy sustainability is critical, keeping energy consumption as low as reasonable possible is an unavoidable challenge for both research infrastructures (RIs) and industry, which collectively operate over 40,000 accelerators. Based on state-of-the-art technology, the portfolio of current and future accelerator-driven RIs in Europe could develop to consume up to 1% of Germany's annual electricity demand. With the ambition to maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of European RIs and to enable Europe’s Green Deal, we propose to Innovate for Sustainable Accelerating Systems (iSAS) by establishing enhanced collaboration in the field to broaden, expedite and amplify the development and impact of novel energy-saving technologies to accelerate particles. For many frontier accelerators superconducting RF (SRF) systems are the enabling technology. iSAS will innovate those technologies that have been identified as being a common core of SRF accelerating systems and that have the largest leverage for energy savings to minimize the intrinsic energy consumption in all phases of operation. In the landscape of accelerator-driven RIs, solutions are being developed to reuse the waste heat produced, to develop energy-efficient magnets and to operate facilities on opportunistic schedules when energy is available. The iSAS project has a complementary focus on the energy efficiency of the SRF accelerating technologies. This will contribute to the vital transition to sustain the tremendous 20th century applications of the accelerator technology in a green and energy conscious 21st century.|10.3030/101131435|Other

The goal of this project is to develop a magnetic multiscale modeling suite that will allow the design and optimisation of magnetic materials and devices based on multiscale modelling, characterisation, and numerical optimisation. To achieve interoperability between software and analysis tools, we will establish a domain ontology for magnetic materials. We will collaborate with EU magnet industry to create standards for linking simulation software for magnetic materials from first principles simulations and micromagnetics to device level simulators. MaMMoS will use artificial intelligence (AI) to fuse modeling and characterization data. AI methods will identify and correct systematic errors in the simulation data, enabling more accurate predictions. Moreover, AI models can fill gaps where measurements are not available. AI models can also serve as a surrogate in multi-objective optimisation. Optimisation will guide further experiments or simulations, reducing the development time. In MaMMoS, we will apply this approach to speed up the development of permanent magnets with reduced critical elements for electric machines and to optimise the layout of magnetic field sensors for high linearity range. The MaMMoS software will be validated against benchmarks defined according to the industrial requirements for electric machine and sensor design. The multiscale magnetic materials modeling suite will be made open source to enable easy access to high-end simulation tools. Interoperability will facilitate data sharing and reuse among researchers and industries. Interpretable machine learning will reveal insights into the physics and chemistry of magnetic materials and guide the discovery of new materials for the European green deal.|10.3030/101135546|Cluster 4

The tunable analog front-end (AFE) interface should be enabled at the fine-grain level by emerging reconfigurable field effect transistor (RFET) and negative differential resistance (NDR) transistor technologies that provide co-integration capabilities with European 22nm CMOS processing technologies allowing for a More-than-Moore sensor technology approach. Being doping-free these two key enabling technologies provide a high potential gain for a large variety of sensor system requiring a low 1/f noise behavior ranging from solid-state sensors, such as photodiodes, to environmental monitoring for the automotive market, and physiological signal monitoring, such as cancer detection. Having naturally un-gated channel areas, reconfigurable field effect transistors are the perfect target vehicle for functionalized surfaces, e.g. for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarkers, serving as a Reconfigurable Sensor Transducer (RST) for the healthcare sector. Together with the AFE, these transducers can be integrated into a CMOS as a use-case demonstration of the flexible platform.

However, the size, cost and scalability of current devices prevents them from reaching their full potential. Photonics is one of the key enabling technologies for quantum technology. In particular, photonics integrated circuits (PICs) with their wafer-level manufacturing based on microfabrication technologies can provide the reduction in size and cost and enable next generation scalable quantum technologies. To fully achieve this goal, an universal PIC technology that can serve most quantum applications is needed.In QU-PIC, we selected the Al2O3 integrated photonics platform as backbone technology for the development of quantum PICs thanks to its excellent low propagation loss performance and wide operating spectral region from the ultraviolet (200 nm) until the mid-infrared. A large range of PIC building blocks is developed in QU-PIC, focusing on areas where materials or integration technologies are not yet available. Several light sources, including multiwavelength tunable lasers with operation at 399 nm, 411 nm and 935 nm on the PIC, UVC external cavity lasers emitting at 280 nm, sources of squeezed photons, single photon detectors, programmable ASICs and the required packaging and assembly technologies will be investigated. An open PDK will group all the developed quantum building blocks to accelerate innovation from the initial idea to an actually manufactured system. Two application demonstrators will be implemented using the developed building blocks, namely a source of GKP states for quantum processing and an atomic clock based on Yb+ ions for quantum sensing.

RESTORE is dedicated to the safe pre-processing of End-of-life (EoL) battery from Electric vehicles (EV) and domestic Lithium-ion Batteries (LIBs), and aims at developing innovative, safe, cost effective and scalable solution for the separation, recovery, purification, upcycling, and validation of materials and metals, to be directly transformed into new battery precursor and functional materials. The proposed solution will shorten the recycling process, while unlocking the recovery of highly valuable materials, currently lost in conventional recycling process, such as the electrolyte, including both the electrolyte salt and solvents, organic binder, graphite and Cathode Active Material (CAM). The project is driven by key industries in Europe, supported by renown research centres, to ensure battery recycling industry will be able to reach the battery directive, and 2030 Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) targets. The concept is based on three building blocks: i) Improving upstream processes for the sorting of batteries and the liberation of non-battery materials from EV battery packs and prohibit them from entering in the downstream process, while maximizing their valorisation, ii) Improving pre-processing of battery materials to effectively separate active and non-active battery materials, ensuring high-purity outputs. iii) Improving the downstream process to efficiently separate all battery materials and refine them to battery-grade standards, to be directly reinjected into the battery production value chain. Finally, with the support of LCA and LCCA through SSbD assessment, the most promising routes based on recycled materials will be validated on coin cells.

There are two glaring omissions, however. The first is a sensitive, high resolution next-generation facility operating at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths (0.35-10 mm), a crucial observing window for the study of a broad range of astrophysical objects, from our Solar System to the Milky Way, nearby galaxies, and the distant universe. The second is that currently planned facilities are not truly prepared to operate in a low carbon emissions future, meeting the needs of the research community and the aspirations of the EU for carbon-neutrality. This project, consolidating the plans for the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), directly addresses both needs, providing solutions that will inform other observatories along the way, especially our partners ESFRI landmark (ESO-ELT) and project (EST). Our ambition is to harness European knowhow and cooperate on a global scale to revolutionise our understanding of the (sub-)mm universe, while pushing observational astronomy towards a greener future. Strengthened by a H2020-funded design study and an engaged community of about 200 researchers worldwide, we have produced science cases, telescope conceptual designs, and plans for a sustainable, off-grid power system. We are now ready to consolidate the AtLAST concept, prototype and test our technology solutions, perform a full lifecycle assessment of the facility, and to expand our user community.

Earth system models (ESMs) are essential tools for projecting climate change, providing important information to decision makers. However, confidence in predicted climate change is undermined by a number of uncertainties; (i) ESMs disagree on how much the Earth will warm for a given increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) (Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity); (ii) how much emitted CO2 will stay in the atmosphere to warm the planet (half the CO2 emitted by humans has been absorbed by the land and ocean) and (iii) how much excess heat in the Earth system will enter the ocean interior, delaying surface warming (~90 % of the heat in the Earth system goes into the ocean). Central to these uncertainties are poorly understood, and poorly modelled, Earth system feedbacks, in particular cloud feedbacks, carbon cycle feedbacks and ocean heat uptake. Poor representation of these phenomena degrades the accuracy of ESM projections, with implications for anticipating future climate extremes and societal impacts. We aim to improve the representation of these feedbacks in ESMs, reducing uncertainty in global warming projections. We propose a multidisciplinary approach, focused on “learning” how to accurately describe processes underpinning these feedbacks, through a fusion of observations with advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Such data and approaches, constrained by the laws of physics, will deliver a step change in the accuracy of Earth system models.

To this end, P2F will integrate information from paleoenvironmental  proxy data, from Earth system models (ESMs), and from rigorous theoretical approaches. Being able to reconstruct past climate evolution is a necessary step for enhancing our capacity to look into the future and, therefore, extensive improvements of state-of-the-art ESMs are needed. So far, ESMs are mainly calibrated and validated with respect to the instrumental records of the last ~170 years of relatively stable climate, while the Earth’s longer-term history is characterised by an interplay of gradual climate change, variability and critical transitions between competing states, with profound impacts on climate subsystems, ecosystems, and civilisations. Understanding the leading dynamical processes and feedbacks and in particular improving our ability to model and anticipate critical transitions in the climate and ecosystems is key to project future climate change on spatio-temporal scales relevant for societies, ecosystems and the planet. In this context, P2F will critically advance our ability to understand and anticipate the main climatic and societal impacts of the ongoing climate crisis. Specifically, P2F will extend the reach of Earth System Models and demonstrate a step change in the model development cycle of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), by providing fully paleo-informed models for future projection and producing a portfolio of plausible future climate change scenarios that are constrained by documented past climate changes and abrupt transitions.

A major challenge is the lack of standardized indicators capturing the effectiveness of adaptation efforts. Existing frameworks often focus on processes but fail to assess long-term resilience outcomes. UNDERPIN aims to bridge this gap by developing indicators that evaluate both short-term results and long-term impacts, helping stakeholders assess how well adaptation actions reduce vulnerabilities and enhance resilience. To achieve this, UNDERPIN will review existing climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction (DRR) indicators and integrate novel data sources, including Earth observation and citizen science.

SOLVE will tackle these challenges by deciphering the mechanisms of induction of long-lasting immunity and evaluating new vaccine platforms. To achieve this goal, an integrated plan has been developed including six pillars: 1) Vaccine discovery and design; 2) Head-to-head evaluation of the immune response and long-lasting immunity induced by four vaccine platforms in the preclinical setting; 3) Validation of the pre-clinical results in an experimental medicine trial (EMT); 4) Immune mechanisms of long-lasting immunity; 5) Data Science; 6) Determinants of population adherence to vaccination. New immunogens including key mutations from most recent variants in RBD and Nucleocapsid sequences highly conserved across Sarbecoviruses,  will be delivered through: antigen-targeting to dendritic cells (DC), i.e., CD40 DC-targeting, nanoparticles, a MVA vector and 2nd generations of mRNAs. SOLVE will evaluate in depth the immunogenicity of these vaccines in the preclinical setting, and in an EMT testing two vaccines, i.e., CD40 DC-targeting and MVA with available GMP clinical lots. SOLVE will benefit from the most advanced technologies to identify the mechanisms of long-lasting immunity. Integrative analyses of high throughput data, including from large cohorts, will provide insights for identification of factors (demographics, vaccines, immunity) which impact quality and longevity of immunity. SOLVE will investigate stakeholders’s perspective on the acceptability of large vaccination campaigns to improve implementation of next generation of vaccines in a preparedness track. The consortium gathers 8 renowned public/private institutions supported by a governance facilitating fast sharing of information to keep up with a tight schedule imposed by the pandemic.|10.3030/101137185|Cluster Health

Focusing on floods in the Greater Horn of Africa and floods and tropical cyclones in Madagascar, we seek to improve the ways climate services are produced, disseminated and used for making short-term and long-term decisions to diminish climate risk. Our strategy is to mitigate five obstacles to climate adaptation: 1) Temporal and spatial mismatches and lack of relevance of climate services; 2) Capacity to implement coping strategies and access to climate services; 3) Governance barriers, including fragmentation of responsibility; 4) Climate change, which can make existing coping strategies obsolete; 5) Lack of evidence on the socioeconomic impacts of climate services. Our consortium is highly multidisciplinary. Social science is strongly represented in our cross-cutting co-production activities, which involve working with peer communities consisting of actors from multiple sectors including policymakers, and community work with 100 vulnerable villages in Madagascar. Our rigorous assessment of the added value of climate services-based interventions in these villages will also be led by social scientists. Climate scientists will steer the co-production of national and regional operational early warning systems and work to enhance the skill of a subseasonal forecast model system. All the partners will be involved in an extensive training and capacity-building programme, which targets vulnerable communities, consortium members including national and regional meteorological services. Our consortium has 14 partners, with strong representation from Africa. It involves actors from all parts of the climate services ecosystem. The reason for mobilising such a broad alliance is to ensure that services and protocols are developed locally, which enables our outcomes to be sustained beyond the lifetime of ACACIA.|10.3030/101137847|Cluster 5

In this project, the focus will be on problems that affect and can be effected by education only. The rise of English as lingua franca caused other languages to be pushed to the sidelines, leading to situations where pupils are less or even not motivated to learn other languages besides English even if it concerns an official national language of their country. Although multilingual programs like Content and Language Integrated Learning can affect these attitudes, the large majority of these kind of programs also use English as target language, which does not increase the proficiency in other (foreign) languages. A second threat to the linguistic capital has to do with the protection of heritage languages, where we see that the linguistic capital of EU-citizens more and more includes non-EU languages. In schools, homelanguages are often rejected and usage of them is sometimes even punished, leading pupils who are ashamed of their linguistic capital and have a lower sense of belonging.  The increasing popularity of new technologies like ChatGPT and machine translation also threatens to acquisition of languages, as pupils do not feel the need to learn languages any more. At the same time, these new technologies offer many opportunities for teachers in their classrooms. All these treats can be managed via good evidence-based policies at different governance levels and by ensuring teachers receive sufficient training and inspiration on how to accept and stimulate the linguistic capital of pupils. This will be done in this project via intense collaboration with stakeholders at different levels, to ensure that sustainable guidelines, policies and practices can be implemented.|10.3030/101178914|Cluster 2

New AI technologies are sites of negotiation and contestation. Different groups, based on their social positions, develop diverse and possibly conflicting ideas on what constitutes “success”. Expanding visions that define AI strictly in terms of technological and economic efficiency, FORSEE aims to develop a nuanced and enriched notion of success that will guide future AI applications and policy efforts. To achieve this, FORSEE draws from the social construction of technology to engage with three categories of stakeholders: a) institutional actors, b) “lifeworld” stakeholders (Civil Society Organizations representing gendered perspectives and Digital SMEs) and, c) the broader public. Then, FORSEE inquires into the impact of AI applications on economy, society and sustainability as well as on their alignment with EU values and strategic priorities. These interconnected research projects will illuminate a broader understanding of success that rests upon conflict resolution, empowerment of stakeholders, and alignment with fundamental rights and the goal of sustainable development. Based on these research findings, FORSEE will (i) develop a novel approach to AI governance that can guarantee more successful AI applications for society as a whole, including (ii) a new evaluative framework for assessing current and future AI applications, and (iii) a new prototype for registering risk and negative impacts. Through these outputs, FORSEE highlights and analyses existing successful AI applications to strategically enhance capabilities of our stakeholders and policymakers to address future risks and opportunities. Updating the SME sector’s understanding of success is a particular condition for the EU to retain a leading position in the AI landscape.|10.3030/101177579|Cluster 2

Observations in the past decades have alerted for the rapid changes in land ice in this region. Record temperatures, melting ice and increased fresh water flux may destabilise the atmosphere and ocean circulation, with severe consequences for regional weather system, sea level rise, and affecting Europe and beyond. An improved understanding of trends and variability of ice evolution is important, and ICELINK will address this challenge by integrating Earth Observation data, in-situ observations and ice flow and climate models into an improved understanding of the processes that control the evolution of glaciers. Through improved understanding of snow, surface mass balance and the ice dynamical response to meltwater runoff, ICELINK will provide new knowledge of the response of Icelandic glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet to global warming and the impacts on climate and ecosystems. ICELINK will engage closely with local communities to co-develop and disseminate new knowledge, needed to support adaptation strategies, mitigate risks and enhance their resilience. A novel approach in ICELINK is to investigate the effect of increasing surface melting on ice evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet by using Icelandic glaciers as a data-observation laboratory for understanding the response in a warmer world with more melt. The improved models and new insights will feed into the World Climate Research Programmes Cryosphere Project, IPCC, IPBES, assist development of Copernicus, and support the Destination Earth Initiative.

In low-and-middle income countries (LMICs), primary care providers often lack sufficient training and resources to effectively diagnose and manage NCDs, while health centres and information systems are poorly organised to ensure continuity of care. Consequently, treatment gaps—defined as the proportion of individuals with a disease who are not treated—are alarmingly high: 82% for hypertension, 80% for diabetes, and 75–85% for epilepsy and mental disorders. The situation is even more critical for individuals with multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs). EMPOWER aims to reduce the burden of MLTC NCDs in Benin and Togo by closing treatment gaps through interventions previously validated in Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar. The project will optimise existing human resources, such as community health workers (CHWs), nurses, midwives, and GPs, by training them in evidence-based NCD management strategies (WHO-PEN and WHO mhGAP) and equipping them with a digital tool. The android-based app will streamline the collection of key indicators for screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of NCDs, while enhancing communication among healthcare providers. CHWs will coordinate a comprehensive package of community-based activities, including NCD screening (targeting cardiometabolic diseases, mental disorders, and epilepsy), risk factor assessments, health education, regular care and follow-up. The 4-year project comprises 3 phases: Phase A, a mixed-methods assessment to gather insights from patients, CHWs and healthcare providers, guiding the adaptation of intervention and tools; Phase B, the implementation of the intervention; and Phase C, a hybrid evaluation of effectiveness outcomes (treatment gaps, NCD-related events, clinical parameters, quality of life, stigma, cost-effectiveness - intervention vs control) and implementation outcomes using the RE-AIM framework.

EAST-STROKE (Early treatment of Atrial fibrillation for Stroke prevention Trial in acute STROKE) is set out to tackle and reduce the individual and societal burden of death and disability by providing evidence for effective secondary prevention using readily available interventions in these patients. To this end, EAST-STROKE is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE) multi- trial to test whether early rhythm control therapy prevents adverse cardiovascular outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. Up to 1,746 patients will be enrolled. Trial organisation relies on a network of experienced clinical researchers, patient representatives and Health Economics experts. Outcome evaluation will involve a comprehensive array of clinical and safety parameters, health and socio-economic outcomes including patient reported outcome measures. We will also perform cost-effectiveness analyses to address the needs of payers and ease implementation into reimbursement schemes. The project addresses a major health burden and will provide evidence for more effective prevention of adverse outcomes in an area of high public health need. We expect that the results of EAST-STROKE will be implemented rapidly throughout Europe, will support health equity, and will prevent more than 150 thousand recurrent strokes or adverse cardiovascular outcomes over a period of five years. By this, EAST-STROKE will lead to significant cost-savings to European health systems and societies.|10.3030/101156541|Cluster Health

This will decisively support the EU in achieving its goal towards climate neutrality by 2050.E-ECO Downstream focuses on the efficient utilization of hydrogen, biogas, and electricity to substitute carbon-based fuels and drastically lower the carbon footprint of the steel production. Energy efficiency is pursued to enable sustainable utilization of volatile green energy. Currently installed burners of reheating furnaces will be enabled to utilize green H2 by integration of newly designed and 3D-printed burner components instead of replacing entire burner systems. To increase fuel flexibility hybrid heating concepts (H2 and electricity) will be investigated in a pilot walking beam furnace. Since the mentioned solutions will change the waste heat streams and their heat recovery in future downstream processes must be reevaluated. This will be done by analysing the partners processes and plants, development and testing of waste heat recovery concepts and recuperators regarding their suitability to new fuels and their off gases, while considering their impact on materials/product. Energy efficiency potentials of downstream processes will be evaluated by case studies for the application of hot charge from casting to hot rolling by covering of the slabs with passive and active panels.The elaborated solutions will be assessed by techno-eco-environmental analysis to evaluate their applicability and to increase their acceptance in the steel community.The E-ECO Downstream consortium has a deep and shared knowledge of iron and steel making, downstream processes and heating technology, materials engineering, numerical simulation, experimental investigations, economy, and life cycle analysis.|10.3030/101178210|Cluster 4

Administrative overburdening arises from a continuous increase in the number of rules that require implementation and the relative stagnation in administrative capacities. This discrepancy between the rules up for implementation and the administrative resources available results in suboptimal policy outcomes, low-quality public services, and inconsistent implementation practices. In view of this assessment, it is the central objective of SUPA to examine strategies for enhancing the capabilities of the public sector to cope with the escalating challenges of administrative overburdening. To this end, SUPA pursues two interrelated objectives: The first one is to examine how decision-making procedures and practices can be improved to limit the overall burdens placed on the administration. The second goal is to explore how administrative structures can be reformed to manage ongoing rule growth effectively. SUPA examines patterns of rule growth and the resulting administrative changes and challenges in six European States (Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the Netherlands) and the European Union. Based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, SUPA (1) evaluates the effectiveness of so-called """"rule-offsetting"""" schemes; (2) investigates how legislators can embed legal design principles to prevent unintended rule growth cascades; (3) assesses how policy growth affects the underlying administrative structures; and (4) examines citizens' experience and operational challenges linked to different ways of distributing implementation burdens across public authorities. SUPA has formed collaboration agreements with multiple public authorities, ensuring that the Consortium's findings can be directly transferred to both policy-makers and administrators in the field."""|10.3030/101177315|Cluster 2

The project covers the entire arc of development from empirical research into how people with disabilities – as forerunners of technology use – perform tasks and interact at work, to theoretical innovation regarding the nature of socio-material assemblages as well as what constitutes technology, to policy recommendations, and to the development of new technological solutions, including AI-based technologies. We consider people with disabilities to be experts in using technical systems to improve their work performance, and through an analysis of a variety of use cases, will identify elements of successful use as well as factors that cause problems for interaction or the performance of tasks. Empirical results will also be generated by surveys and co-creation activities. People with disabilities will be engaged in NewWorkTech in line with the principle “nothing about us without us”. NGO partners will be actively involved as facilitators in the empirical research and as drivers of application and dissemination. Through our own technological development effort, attention to the ethical use of technologies, and the dissemination of the knowledge we generate, the results will feed into improved usage methods and functionality of work-related technologies, as well as knowledge about the required skills. The smart use of technology thus achieved will help create employment opportunities for people with disabilities, improving their quality of life and reducing inequalities while also helping alleviate the current shortage of labour in Europe, and open possibilities for more efficient and creative use of technology by everyone, whether they have physical or cognitive limitations or not.|10.3030/101177176|Cluster 2

The differences among patients and the heterogeneous and plastic nature of each individual tumour have resulted in all therapeutic clinical trials failing during the past 20 years. Recently, immunotherapy has been showing great promise, but only in subsets of patients. Identifying those patients cannot be done a priori as biomarkers are still largely missing, nor are we able to follow-up on therapeutic efficacy when patients get treated. The GLIOMATCH project aims at improving the clinical outcome of GBM/pHGG patients by enabling immunology-based patient stratification to empower personalised matching of appropriate immunotherapy, while improving follow-up of clinical responses to existing/novel therapeutics. This will be achieved by integrating spatially resolved, multi-layered tissue maps (using integrated single-cell multiomics), with non-invasive MRI images. This integration will fuel into a novel MRI Radio-multiomics hub, that will be made available to clinical professionals through which they can perform tumour-host based patient stratification and personalised therapy matching while interpreting longitudinal follow-up and treatment efficacy. The proposed data-driven models will be developed by analysing the largest cohort of immuno-oncology (I/O) treated GBM/pHGG patients (n>300, including pre-post treatment samples) with matched controls (n>300) and exceptionally long-term surviving GBM patients (n~140), in which various tumour-host niches will be studied in how they respond to I/O perturbations and lead to improved clinical outcome. This will be empowered by deploying an UNCAN-compatible data lake, to which incremental data collection will be used to further refine the machine learning models, while proposing novel treatment options.

Cryogenic propellant combinations such as oxygen / methane offer higher specific impulses than storable combinations, but their low saturation temperatures raise additional challenges with respect to preventing their evaporation during long-term storage. While the ability to refuel craft with cryogenic propellants would allow for longer-term manned missions to Mars and the Moon, as well as aid in the improvement of in-space sustainability, preventing the evaporation of the propellants during the transfer process also poses challenges. As of today, neither long-term storage nor refuelling with cryogenic propellants has been demonstrated in-orbit. CRYSALIS will develop and mature the technologies needed for the management of cryogenic propellant for future space transportation and in-orbit servicing activities. This maturation will include performing a small-scale in-orbit demonstration to mature those whose performance can only be characterised in a microgravity environment. This will be a closed-system demonstrator flown on-board the Nyx capsule, which will aim to not only demonstrate the feasibility of such processes but will aim to improve the understanding of the behaviour of such propellants under microgravity, allowing for development of future systems. These technologies will aid in ensuring the independent access of the EU to space, in particular to manned and heavy missions beyond GEO and LEO, by supporting the development of a logistical network of craft, depots, and hubs, required for cis-lunar and future Martian missions.|10.3030/101135431|Cluster 4
